BreweryKeeper
=============

A website that allows users to record breweries that they have visited. The site will interact with a database which will record each user's breweries, as well as hold a master list of all of the breweries.

The master list of breweries will (hopefully) become an extensive list of breweries, and can be used as a resource for people interested in visiting the wonderful place where beer is made. The site will have a form for authenticated users to add breweries, making it a crowd-sourced list.
